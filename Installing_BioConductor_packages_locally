# Here is how to install Bioconductor packages locally in SHAMU
# Do this in the interactive BASH terminal
# You have to be using R/3.5.1 for this to work any of the newer versions of R will be a fatal error and kill the program

$ . /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
# Load one of these
$ module load R/3.5.1

$ source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")

# now use the bioLite(c("")) command to pull in any Bioconductor package and save in locally
$ biocLite(c("DESeq2", "Rsubread"))

# Save all of this and now when you run your Rscript you only have to use the library(DESeq2) or library(Rsubread) command to call those packages
